### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, currently I work as a Lecturer in Informatics Department.

Courses: Informatics Mathematics, Data Warehousing and Distributed Databases, Simulation and Modeling, Web Programming, Mobile Programming and Ubiquitous Programming.

Approach: Problem-Based Learning, Case-Based Learning and Project-Based Learning.

Right now, I'm sticking with GitHub as my go-to repository for all my program samples. I'm also keen on diving deeper into other GitHub functionalities down the road as part of my ongoing learning journey.
